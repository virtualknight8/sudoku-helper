# Sudoku Solver with Tricks in JavaScript

This is a Sudoku solver written in JavaScript that can solve any valid Sudoku puzzle. The solver uses Sudoku tricks such as obvious singles, doubles and triples, and hidden singles and doubles to find the solution.

## Getting Started

To use this Sudoku solver, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter the Sudoku puzzle you want to solve in the input fields or go to https://mugsend.github.io/sudoku-solver/.
4. Click the "Solve" button to solve the puzzle.
5. If a solution exists, it will be displayed on the page.

## How it Works

The Sudoku solver first applies the Sudoku tricks to fill in as many cells as possible. If it can't fill in any more cells, it stops and displays the result. If there are still empty cells, it applies the tricks again, and repeats until no more cells can be filled in. If there are still empty cells, the solver declares the puzzle unsolvable.

The Sudoku tricks used by the solver are:

- Obvious Singles: If a cell has only one possible value, fill it in.
- Obvious Doubles: If two cells in a row, column, or box have the same two possible values, those values must go in those two cells and no others.
- Obvious Triples: If three cells in a row, column, or box have the same three possible values, those values must go in those three cells and no others.
- Hidden Singles: If a number can only go in one cell in a row, column, or box, fill it in.
- Hidden Doubles: If two numbers can only go in two cells in a row, column, or box, those numbers must go in those two cells and no others.
